Sales Management System is a very large and complex project.
    It consists of various classes and sub-classes that further consist of many features and functions related to items entry,
    items recording, billing.
    Features:
        1) Menu - The features under ‘main menu’ in this sales management system project in JAVA are purchase products,
                  list of products, edit products life and bills report. The ‘edit menu’ allows users to add,
                  modify and delete products.
        2) Product - The ‘product’ class controls all the functions and features related to products/items.
                     It is further divided into two sub-classes: public and private. Under ‘public’ sub-class, users can add, modify,
                     list, purchase and delete products/items. Under the ‘private’ sub-class of sales management system project in
                     JAVA, users can display, modify and delete records. Additional features in ‘private’ are returning the code of
                     the last record in the product file, returning the record number of the given code in the product file, etc.
        3) Account - It controls all the functions in sales management system related to making bills.
                     Like ‘product’, it is divided into ‘public’ and ‘private’ sub-classes. The ‘private’ is just for
                     variable declaration, whereas the ‘public’ sub-class allows users to operate functions such as
                     list bill, prepare bill, add bill, and more.
